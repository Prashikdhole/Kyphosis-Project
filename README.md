# Kyphosis-Project

Used Pandas for Data analytics
Target profiling to identify imbalanced data using pandas. SMOTE (imb) to increase minority target records.
Build Pocâ€™s using Scikit-learn to select the best model for - Classification using Random forest classifiers, svn, decision trees, logistic regression using etc scikit-learn
Final model selection- After hyperparametric tuning using gridsearchcv, got a test accuracy of 97%, Recall 98%, precision, f1 score percent with random forest classifier after probability scaling using Numpy (post-processing) by changing threshold from 0.5 to 0.65.

Skills used: Pandas, Numpy, scikit-learn, SMOTE
